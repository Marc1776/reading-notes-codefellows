## HTML Tables

Tables are more complex structures than a basic HTML layout, so if they're used to layout a page they reduce accessiblity of screen readers, makes code harder to write, maintain, and debub, and they're not automatically responsive so tehy don't default to parent width, but rather size according to content.
  
<td> table data is the table cell, smallest container inside a table
  
<tr> table row, defines a table row and allows the addition of more rows
  
<th> table header, allows column and row headings to stand out
