2.  Diversity of backgrounds brings a multitude of experiences that have developed how people think, how they approach problems, how they innovate, and their world view.  These experiences can explore problems before they occur, they can give insight into services or options no one else could think about, and they provide a new understanding into how the market works in varying locations.
