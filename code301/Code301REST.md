## REST

## Why this is important

## Questions

1.  Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers and the protocol for getting pages from servers to browsers.

2.  The techniques that developers that came after Fielding were designed to talk to a small group of machines, whereas Fielding used techniques to talk to all the machines in the world.

3.  HTTP protocol uses GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH to do or get something from anther machine.

4.  GET retrieves information from another machine.

5.  POST when a machine adds something to another system

6.  PUT when a machine wants to replace something in another machine

7.  PATCH when a machine wants to partially update something in another machine

## Things I want to know more about

HTTP, the concept seems simple, but I know theres more to it.
