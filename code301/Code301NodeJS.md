# Node.JS

##  Why it's important

Node.JS will be useful because it will be working directly to execute js on my computer.

NPM will be useful because it's a giant resource for code and programs

Pair programming seems to be an industry standard because it produces higher quality code, even though it takes longer, do it once vs do it twice.

## Node.js

1.  Node.js is a program, based on Google's V8 javascript engine, used to execute javascript on our computer.

2.  Chrome's V8 engine compiles javascript directly to native machine code so my computer can exectue the code.

3.  That it's a program used to execute javascript on my computer

4.  NPM is a package manager and installer, also the largest software library

5.  18.7.0

6.  8. 15. 0

7.  npm install -g jshint

8.  NPM is used for developing apps with modern javascript frameworks, npm relies on Node to create a good development environment to run on.

## Pair programming

1.  Reasons for pair programming:
    - Greater efficiency
    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
    - Social skills
    - Job interview readiness
    - Work environment readiness

2.  I've found that 'greater efficiency' has been the most beneficial for me, allowing me to bounce ideas or questions off someone else while writing prevents returning to code to refactor or fix it.

3.  There's a driver and a navigator:  Driver is the one programming, they're the ones writing the code.  Navigator guides the driver and reviews code while it's being written and looks forward to the next aspect of the work; to include looking up solutions or documentation.

## Things I want to know more about:

NPM, has to be the largest registry for a reason.
