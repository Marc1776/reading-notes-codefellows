# React and Forms

##  Why this is important

Forms will always be an integral part of websites; people are looking for items or specific information and the only way to get that to them efficiently is through their input.

Ternary allows devs to make the results of user input more relevant to them by eliminating unnecessary or inapplicable information/results.

## Forms

1.  A component that renders and form and controls what happens in the form based on user input.

2.  Depending on the use, I think updating the state as they enter them is a better way to go so that they can see what they're actually inputting as they do so.  This will allow them to catch typos or errors.

3.  We use the value attribute in conjunction with the < input type="text" >, < textarea >, or < select > tags.

## Conditional (ternary) Operator

1.  A ternary operator can be used to reduce normal if statements and 5 lines of code down to 1 line of code

2. x===y ? True : False;


## Things I want to know more about

Ternary seems to be a pretty good deal, looking at the more complex and nested versions, it still seems to simplify the process, but using it in actual code will determine that.
