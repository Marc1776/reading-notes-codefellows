# Class 11: Audio, Video & Images

## Video & Audio

Early use of video required flash or silverlight, but now-a-days html is used with javascript API's as controls.

The source attribute is the same as used in an image, and contains the path to the video being embedded.

The control attribute allows users to control video and audio playback.  

It's important to have fallback content inside the video element because if the browser doesn't support the video for whatever reason, at least the user can still access the direct link to the video.

## Grid

Flex was designed to be a one-dimensional tool, whereas grid is two-dimensional.

Grid container:  the element being displayed where the grid is applied, the direct parent of all grid items.

Grid item:  the direct descendants of the container.

Grid Line:  dividing lines that create the structure of the grid, either horizontal or vertical (row or column grid lines, respectively).

Grid Cell:  the space between 2 row and 2 column grid lines

Grid Track:  the entire column or row of a grid

## Responsive Images

Repsonsive images, other than being aesthetically appealing, should be used because they can adjust to keep the main focus on the important parts of the images regardless of the screen size they are viewed on.  

< img > is used to direct the browser to the image source file

< srcset > & < sizes > are both used to direct the browser, and allow it to choose, to the correct picture to use based on screen size.
