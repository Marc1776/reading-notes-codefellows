# MongoDB and Mongoose

## Why this is important

Each type of database has different benefits based on use or data, knowing when to use one type over the other is a big factor in designing an application.

##  NOSQL VS SQL

Difference table:

SQL databases are table based, NoSQL are document, key-value pair, graph or wide-column based.

SQL are vertically scalable by upgrading hardware power and NoSQL are scaled horizontally by increasing database servers to reduce load

SQL is used to define and manipulate data NoSQL focuses queries on collection of documents.

SQL has predefined schema and NoSQL have dynamic schema

1.  A good fit for a SQL database is something that has a high transaction base

2.  I think something real world to fit that is an online retailer.

3.  NoSQL is good for large amounts of data

4.  I think Facebook would be a good fit for NoSQL since they gather a lot of data on people and store it.

5.  NoSQL is better for hierarchical data storage.

6.  Which database is better for scalability depends on several factors, but to expand SQL requires server hardware upgrade whereas NoSQL requires more servers.

#### Video questions

1.  SQL = Structured Query Language

2.  Relations are how SQL databases keep data matched to other data: example customer contact data with the customer.

3.  Relational works with SQL

4.  Schema is an organization of data.

5.  NonStructured Query Language

6.  It uses documents to store all the data.

7.  Documents

8.  MongoDB is more flexible: because of the lack of schema adhearance requirements, data items can be adjusted without adding new schema to all records

9.  Duplicate data is more common because the documents don't require the same schema across the board.

## Things I want to know more about:

A lot of new verbiage in today's read.
