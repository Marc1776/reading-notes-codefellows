Most of the material covered is really just the ground work to make JS work and how more complex versions will be built.

## HTML lists, control flow, and CSS box model

Unordered lists are used when creating a list where order is not important or meaningless and are typically displayed with a bullet.

The bullets style can be changed in CSS with the list-style-type property

An ordered list is used when the order of list items is important, such as instructions or recipes.

To change the ordered list items to roman numberals instead of numbers would be to use <ol type="i"> </ol> or adjust the starting place at <ol start="4"> would start the list from 4 and continue in order.


## CSS Box Model

In the example of a castle, the margin would be the moat around the wall, the wall is the border, and the space between the castle and the wall is the padding, with the castle as the content.

## JS

Arrays can store strings, numbers, object, other arrays, and it data types can be mixed in an array.

Yes, the example is a valid array, to access the values stored would be people[][] based on which value you wanted.

Shorthand operators:
  
  x = f()  assignment x is this
  
  x += f() or x-= f() or x *= f() or x /= f() ; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division assignments, these mean this: x = x +, -, * or / f()
  
  A real world example of using a conditional statement in JS could be if a site was asking for a specific input, like a number for an age the conditional statement being met could move on to another question or the page itself; while a text answer would return to the original question until an appropriate number is input.
  
  A loop is useful in js when we want a function to run for a specified numbers of times or until a certain condition is met.
