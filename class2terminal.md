# Coder's Computer, terminal notes:

Commands

o	**pwd** – where am I?

o	**ls** – list, lists all the content where I am currently

o	**cd** – change directory (ex: cd projects)

o	**mkdir** – “make directory” (ex: mkdir class102, command + name;)
  	pay attention to capitalization and spacing, a space will give you two new directories, ie: mkdir class 102 will get a class and a 102 folder
  	push names all together or use a dash
    
o	**clear** – clears out the terminal text, doesn’t change locations, for visual only in terminal

o	**touch** – create a file
  	Ex: touch demo.md
    
o	**code .** – says to open VS code where I currently am

o	**cd ..** – change directory back one
 	Add more periods to go back further
  
o	**Tree** – visual of all the directories and files of where I currently am

o	**Reset** – will reset the terminal

o	 **git clone** (copy here the repo address saved earlier)
o	 Gitflow:acp (add, commit, push)
o	 **git status** (gives update with what is going on)
o	 **code .** open VS code with my current work
o	 **git add then file name** (capitalization important)
o	 **git commit -m “message”** actually saves the file with a message
o	 On VS, if there is a dot, that indicates a change that has not saved
o	 **git push origin main** 
o	can also add multiple files at once  **git add newfile.md newfile2.md newfile3.md**
o	**git add .** will add everything that has changes
o	**git pull origin main** pulls changes made on github onto my computer
o	Just make all changes in the VS instead of bouncing back and forth.
