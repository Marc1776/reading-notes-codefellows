# Coder's Computer, terminal notes:

Commands

o	**pwd** – where am I?

o	**ls** – list, lists all the content where I am currently

o	**cd** – change directory (ex: cd projects)

o	**mkdir** – “make directory” (ex: mkdir class102, command + name;)
  	pay attention to capitalization and spacing, a space will give you two new directories, ie: mkdir class 102 will get a class and a 102 folder
  	push names all together or use a dash
    
o	**clear** – clears out the terminal text, doesn’t change locations, for visual only in terminal

o	**touch** – create a file
  	Ex: touch demo.md
    
o	**code .** – says to open VS code where I currently am

o	**cd ..** – change directory back one
 	Add more periods to go back further
  
o	**Tree** – visual of all the directories and files of where I currently am

o	**Reset** – will reset the terminal
