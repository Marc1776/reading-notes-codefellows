# JavaScript Fundamentals










## Sidenotes from class:

console.log can help with troubleshooting by letting me see the output to js functions and tells me what is happening.

alert is used to display something to a user, but not really used as a question, because there is no way for the user to provide input

prompt is used to get input from the user, such as 'what is your name?', gives us a value from the user

let name = prompt('What is your name?');  from let to semicolon is the entire js statement, prompt is going to be the expression located in the statement.

if 'let name =' is removed, then we don't get a value of the user's name stored so when the next line to call for the valuue is added, nothing will happen:
prompt('What is your name?');
console.log('Your name is : ' + name);

The prompt will appear, but the value won't be created.
