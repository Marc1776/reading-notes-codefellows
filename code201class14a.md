## Transform

The CSS transform property allows a user to layout an element in two dimensional or three dimensional settings.

An example of a transform could be on a site that sells some sort of product and they want users to be able to see the whole product, like a car.  They can use the 3d version of transform and allow users to turn the car and see the front, sides and rear or angle the vehicle so they can see the top.

## Transitions and Animations

Transitions can alter the appearance or behavior of an element when a change of state occurs; mouse hovers, is focused on, active or targetd.

Animation keyframes set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition. [shayhowe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

Some of the benefits to using transitions on websites are that it really makes it about the user of the site, allows them to focus on what they've selected, makes it more aesthetically appealing and allows the user to interact with the site instead of just browsing.

Transform, transitions, and animations will all give me more control over the CSS which can help let me really be creative.  They give me more tools to make my site more like the version I have in my head.

## Things I want to know more about:

A more solid understanding of CSS itself and how layout work together (or don't) will make this a more useful tool.
