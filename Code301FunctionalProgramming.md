# Functional Programming

## Why this is important

Modules will be important for organizing code based on functionality, keeps the code clean and easier to revisit or be visited by others.

## Functional Programming Concepts

1.  > "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

2.  A pure function will return the same result if given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects.

3.  Pure functions are easier to test

4.  Immutability is when data's state can't be changed after it's created, you have to create a new object with the new value.

5.  When a function will yield the same results for the same input consistently.

## Node.js Modules and require()

1.  A module is kind of like a component in React, modules are code that have a certain functionality in the code and is called when it's needed.

2.  'Require()' requires a module to be used by linking directly to the module in the syntax

3.  In the module we want to be used elsewhere, we have to add 'module.exports = name" and in the area we want it to be used we have to add var name = require('/filepath');

4.  module.exports - name;

## Things I want to know more about

If I wanted to use multiple functions in one other page.
