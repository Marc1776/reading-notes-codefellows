# React, State and Props

## Why this is important:



## React Lifecycle

1.  From the diagram, it appears that 'render' happens first.

2.  Constructor is the first thing to happen in the lifecycle.

3.  Constructor, render, React updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount.

4.  componentDidMount is used to initialize the DOM or to load items from a network request.

## State and Props

1.  Passing initial information, static information, in props.

2.  State is inside of a component, props are outside the component and you pass into a component, state is handled inside the component.

3.  Application needs to re-render when soemthing needs to be updated, stored in a state.

4.  To update things, state is used to store items to be updated, such as the counter the count needs to be update based on input,  inside of a form where there is an input section (checkbox, user input etc)
