# Class 09 Forms and JS Events

## HTML Forms

[MDN Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)

Forms are important because they are a main point of interaction between a site and its user.  When the user inputs data, that information can be processed and stored or immediately used to make the page more relevant to that user.

When designing a form, as with other site designs, the first thing is to sketch it out so that you know what kind of data you are trying to get from the user.  To minimize frustration, get the least amount of input as is needed.  

< form > defines the form and is a container element like section but specifically for containing forms.

< label > provides text for the names the input fields

< input > defines how the input element appears and behaves (< input type="email" designates this to only accept an email address), empty element no closing tag.

< textarea > is a multi-line text field

< button > allows the user to do something by simply clicking the element on the page, submitting or resetting.
