# More CRUD

## Why this is important

Most sites store data in some form or another and getting the data from user to database requires the use of CRUD through RESTful applications.

## CRUD Basics

1.  Put

2.  The delete function requires an ID to delete the correct item.

## Building a CRUD API

1.  CRUD uses REST to communicate with it's databases and the web entirely.  The principles of create, read, update, and delete mirror those of REST as post, get, put, delete.

2.  Set up routes
    - Set up / test routes 
    - connect to database
    - set up schema
    - set up post, put, delete
    - test post, put, delete

## Things I want to know more about

My understanding of the relationship of CRUD and REST is basic at best.
