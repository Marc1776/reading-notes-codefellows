## Reading Questions

### How the web works:

Thousands of tiny packets of data are transferred through a variety of tools getting from a storage place on a server to a being downloaded and displayed on a  clients/users computer browser.

The files are separated into the HTML, CSS and JS and sent separately as needed.  HTML goes first as it tells the browser what is going to be used, as the HTML is parsing, the browser sends back requests for CSS files and JS files as it comes across those elements.  

Since many images are copyright protected, use google images with googles license filter of *creative common licenses* found under *usage rights*

A string is created by wrapping text in single quotations ex:  let myVariable = 'text';

A number is simply the digits ex:  let myVariable = 7;

A variable is where values are stored and they're important because if values were set we couldn't do things like a personalized greeting or changing an image in a gallery.

### HTML

An attribute contains information about an element, but doesn't appear in content.  

An HTML elemnt is made up of an opening and closing tag with content between the two.

Article tags are used to enclose content that can stand on it's own without the rest of the page.  Section tags are similar but group together parts of a page to create a theme.

Webpages typically have a header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar and a footer.

Metadata can influence search engine optimization for good and bad, a typical page will use the metadata to populate relevant search terms for search engines, but it can also be used to flood search engines by just adding popular keywords to lead people to the site.

Meta is used as follows:  <meta name="author" content="Name"> or <meta name="description" content="blah blah blah...">

### Starting a webpage

The first step to web design should be planning or *project ideation*, where a lot of questions need to be explored, such as 
- What am I trying to accomplish?
- What do I need to do to reach my goals?  And in what order?
- How does a website help meet those goals?

The most important question to answer is the first one:
> what am I trying to accomplish?

### Semantics

The h1 element is a semantic element which has meaning as the top level heading on the page, the span element has no semantic value; while both elements can be designed to look the same, browsers view them differently.

Semantic value or meaning allows search engines to find the page, tells a developer what type of data will populate, makes it easier to find meaningful code, and allows tools like a screen reader to help visually impaired navigate a page.

### JavaScript

Two things that would require JS are things that require input or action from the user and animations.  HTML and CSS can create a page alone, but it would be static and would have to be up dated in the code every time. 

JS is added with <script> element.
