# Class 12 chart.js, Canvas

It appears that Canvas and Chart.js will work together to present data in a more clean and easier to understand manner than previously with tables.  

## Canvas

< canvas > element is a feature of HTML5 that allows programmers to draw 2 dimensional graphics using JS.

The closing tag < /canvas > is important because it provides 'fallback' content to display if the browser doesn't support the canvas element.

getContext () method is a feature of < canvas > that returns a render context object.

## chart.js

Chart.js is literally a chart to display information or statistics, ex: a bar chart, pie chart, radar, scatter, etc..  It is brought into a project by including the script in the page along with < canvas > to render the chart.

Displaying data visually with a chart is both easier to look at and conveys the data more quickly.  It' is easier to see a trend with a graph than looking straight at numbers.

Chart.js would help my previous applications by making it almost instant to identify which picture was clicked on the most with a pie chart, the biggest slice will be obvious, versus having to sort through a table of 19 items to find the highest number.
