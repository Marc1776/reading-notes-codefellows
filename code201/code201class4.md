## HTML links

The < a > element with the href (or hypertext reference) attribute that contains the web address is how we create a link.

The href contains the web address.

Adding a title attribute to the < a > element will give screen readers and other accessibility means the information they need to give to the user.

## CSS layout

Normal flow is the layout elements would follow if CSS isn't applied to change their behavior.

Block level element's content fills the available space of the parent element and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.

Inline elements are just the size of their content, can't set the width or height.

Static

Absolute positioning allows us to isolate an element so that it doesn't interfere with outher layout elements of a page, such as pop-up boxes, control menus, rollover panels, or features that can be dragged and ropped anywhere on the page.

Absolute positioning fixes an element in place to its nearest positioned ancestor, while fixed positioning can fix an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)
