## Group work

[Teams](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

From my experience thus far, programmers have figured out that collaborating and sharing ideas with each other is exponentially more beneficial to the programming world as a whole, rather than going it alone; and they've known this for a very long time.  In my previous profession, everything was based on team work and it all built upon itself as the organization grew from a team of 4 to a battalion of 800.  

This extremely long-winded article used a whole lot of words, and google used millions of dollars of manpower and hours to research, to reach a conclusion that most people who have worked in groups outside of high school already knew; there is no one right answer to groups.  One of the problems with c-suite execs, government organizations, and senior military leaders is that they sincerely believe that there is a master key out there somewhere that will allow them to unlock the unicorn onesize fits all answer to their problems.  When they find that key and apply to their organization, suddenly all the problems will disappear while productivity and efficiency will rise sharply.  Google figured this out early in the article when they couldn't pin point consistent data to point to the secret to successful groups.  

Human beings are far more complex than the above groups give them credit to be.  If they weren't then google could just throw a team together of experts and have consistently great results all the time, but as they learned, some of the most accomplished individuals put together did collectively less than they probably would have alone.  In the most non-technical way I can put it, sometimes people just don't jive together and it could entirely be for a reason no one can identify.  Have you as the reader ever met someone you just didn't like, and you had no real reason for it?  I've found that usually, even if a group doesn't work well together, they will at least work well enough to get the job done.  If it wasn't efficient or above average, then creating that group again would be a bad idea.
