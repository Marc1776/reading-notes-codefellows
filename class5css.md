# CSS

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

Ex: this would make the main header red and large 

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

Changes to CSS are controlled so that old websites still work on current code.
