# Bash Command Line

## Command Line

The command line is where I, as a user, am able to input text commands to have the computer do something; navigate to a file, install tools, display versions of software.  What I didn't know was that commands can be modified with an option, and options typically start with -.  Everything after a command is an argument, or as I interpreted it as a way to further narrow down what I want to happen or where; previously I only really used it to navigate to folders quicker ie cd project/courses/class/lab.

## Basic Navigation

Where has the tab completion been this whole time?!?  I only recently learned during 301 that I could cd using (what I now know as) an absolute path to get down to the directory I want to be in, rather than my previous method of using relative path to go into each and every directory until I got where I wanted to be.  Honestly I had forgotten about pwd, I tend to just use ls wherever I am and go from there.
