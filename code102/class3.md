Revisions and the cloud notes:

 ## Git
o	Can link other pages in my repository to my other pages by using the link code [name](class1.md) instead of putting in the entire html address

o	Version control system

o	Mult devs can work on the same code

o	History of changes

o	Ability to view, apply and remove the changes

o	All project files in one repository

o	Commits are basically “save as” and represents each successive version of the file

o	HEAD label = ‘you are here’

o	Messages are like writing a caption

•	## Github

o	Not git (this is the online code storage)

o	A way to share code with others

o	Online place to store your code

o	Uses git to help manage team’s work

  	Version tracking
    
  	Review changes
    
  	Keep changes separate until you want them added
    
 ## Git + github
 
o	Lots of team members can work together on the same files, without messing each other up

o	Work on the code on your own computer, then sync online when ready

•	A respository (repo) is a colletion of files that I have told git to pay attention to

o	Usually one project = one repository

o	Large project can have 1 repo for each section of the project (front end vs back end)

o	Can live on github and/or my computer

**cloning**
By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.
