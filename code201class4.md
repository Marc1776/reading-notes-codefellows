## HTML links

The < a > element with the href (or hypertext reference) attribute that contains the web address is how we create a link.

The href contains the web address.

Adding a title attribute to the < a > element will give screen readers and other accessibility means the information they need to give to the user.

## CSS layout

Normal flow is the layout elements would follow if CSS isn't applied to change their behavior.

Block level element's content fills the available space of the parent element and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content.

Inline elements are just the size of their content, can't set the width or height.
