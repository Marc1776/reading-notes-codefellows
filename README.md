## About Me

I live in and grew up in Arizona.  I spent 14 years in the US Army as an airborne infantryman, stationed on 3 continents, 4 countries, and 5 states.  I was retired 2 years ago, and spent 2 years in the construction industry as a tester & inspector.  I studied interdisciplinary studies at Arizona State University with concentrations in political science and history.  I try to be as active as my body will let me, I recently started working my scuba certification and after a quick trip to the dentist I should be able to certify at lake Pleasant.  I also enjoy wood working and cars.  I'm married with 2 children.

### **Growth Mindset**

#### What is it?

The state of mind that encourages learning, intellectual growth, and skill development.  It is a tool that allows me to overcome self-defeating thoughts that arise when problems, failures, or other set-backs occur. 

3 reminders for growth mindset:

- This is a new topic, it is ok to not know.

- Ask, ask, ask.  15 minutes of attempts, then ask for help.

- Do not expect to master all the skills during school, "good enough for government work" applies for now.
