### **Growth Mindset**

#### What is it?

The state of mind that encourages learning, intellectual growth, and skill development.  It is a tool that allows me to overcome self-defeating thoughts that arise when problems, failures, or other set-backs occur. 

3 reminders for growth mindset:

- This is a new topic, it is ok to not know.

- Ask, ask, ask.  15 minutes of attempts, then ask for help.

- Do not expect to master all the skills during school, "good enough for government work" applies for now.
