My name is Marc, I have a lot to learn in this new world. 

## About Me

I live in and grew up in Arizona.  I spent 14 years in the US Army as an airborne infantryman, stationed on 3 continents, 4 countries, and 5 states.  I was retired 2 years ago, and spent 2 years in the construction industry as a tester & inspector.  I studied interdisciplinary studies at Arizona State University with concentrations in political science and history.  I try to be as active as my body will let me, I recently started scuba diving, I will be open water certified after a couple trips to lake Pleasant.  I also enjoy wood working and cars.  I'm married with 2 children.
