My name is Marc, I have a lot to learn in this new field.

## About Me

I live in Arizona.  I spent 14 years in the US Army as an Airborne Infantryman and was stationed in 3 continents, 4 countries, and 5 states.  I was retired 2 years ago, and since then I was a project manager in the construction industry.  I studied interdisciplinary studies at Arizona State University with concentrations in political science and history.  I joined Code Fellows to learn a new hard skill in the technology industry as a software developer.
