## CSS Flexbox

The parent element containing the display: flex is the 'flex container'

Items set as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called flex items.  [MDN flex box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)

Flexbox is described as one-dimensional because it will either expand or shrink to fit into available space.

Left to right is main start to main end, along the main axis.  Top to bottom is cross start to cross end, along the cross axis.

A downside to flexboxes is that some older browsers may not support it, which could entirely break the layout making it unusable. 

Flexbox vs float, flexbox is designed to make layout designs easier.  While it is possible to do the things flexbox does with float, flexbox is specifically designed to do layouts in a much simpler way without a lot of tweaking.

This topic helps immensely.  My first 2 projects I was significantly frustrated by not getting content centered very easily or being able to take up space in a way that looks clean.  Flexbox will give me a lot more control over my sections and allow me to simply put the content where I want in a way that is faster, easier, and will make my code look cleaner.
