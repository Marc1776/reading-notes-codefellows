# React Code 301 Reading Notes

Componenets are a fundamental part of React, so this specific concept is important to understand because React is built upon it and if I want to be proficient with the tool, I need to understand it's foundation.

## Component-Based Architecture

1.  A component is:
> "A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties."

2.  What are the characteristics of a component:

Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent

3.  What are the advantages of using component-based architecture:

Easy to deploy, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent

## What is Props and how to use it in React

1.  What is 'props' short for:

Properties

2.  how are props used in React:

To pass data from one component to another

3.  What is the flow of props:

Uni-directional from parent to child.



## Things I want to know more about:

On the surface the concept makes sense and I can see why componenets will be useful.  I do however wonder about future use and I'm having some trouble thinking of how I would have applied it to previous projects or work.
