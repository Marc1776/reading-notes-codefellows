# Code 201 Class 10, troubleshooting

## JS troubleshooting

Syntax errors are spelling errors that occur in the written code and prevent the program from running or the program will partially work.

A logic error on the otherhand is an error that occurs when the program runs, but the results are incorrect.

Syntax errors usually provide some sort of error message, while logic errors usually do not.

I have had a smaller share of syntax errors in the past, they are usually not capitalizing a value's name or missing a semi-colon, the lintr program usually helps me spot those quickly.  I have more logic errors, which tend to leave me guessing at what went wrong, because the logic in my head must work right?

This topic will probably cause me to slow down even more to make sure I'm using the correct functions, objects or prototypes and that they will work together as intended; following closely to make sure I actually call them as well.

## JS Debugger

The debugger tool is something that lets you select a line of code in JS to actually have the code pause running so that you can verify up to that point whether the code is providing the intended logic or results.

A breakpoint is the line where you pause the code.

The call stack shows what code has been executed to get to the current line.

## Things I want to know more about:

I'm particularly interested in using break points for debugging.  Knowing that half my code is doing what I want it to do is very reassuring and reduces demoralization from a logic error.
